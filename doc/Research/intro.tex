This document is intended to describe the research work conducted using the research platform \muemat.
\muemat is a Matlab prototype to both design a new C++ multigrid library (\mloo) and experiment with new multigrid algorithms.
More specifically, we are interested to introduce energy minimization algorithms in the next generation of the multigrid library.

This document is organized as follows:
In \S\ref{amg}, we introduce the basic ingredient of AMG method and the importance of the prolongation/restriction strategies.
In \S\ref{emin}, we present the energy minimization method. 
\S\ref{work} is focus on the research work: we discuss our main choices, present results to support them and summarize open questions.
