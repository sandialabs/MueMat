An important part of the \mloo project is the matlab code called \muemat.
\muemat serves many purposes.  First, it is intended to guide the design of \mloo by allowing for rapid prototyping and
testing of algorithms and design decisions.
Second, it is intended to be the first introduction to \mloo for students and new developers.
Third, it acts as a living part of the design documentation.

A main tenet is that \muemat will mirror the design of \mloo.  Any capability in \mloo should be present in \muemat, but
not necessarily vice versa.  While \muemat is written in Matlab, it makes heavy use of classes and inheritance.
