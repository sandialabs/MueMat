This planning document is intended to record some design ideas and decisions for the new algebraic multigrid libary \mloo.
\mloo is meant to be both a research vehicle and a replacement for \ML in existing applications.  (Obviously,
those codes would have to use \Tpetra instead of \Epetra.)  Hence, \mloo must be flexible enough to
support new algorithm development, but also robust enough for everyday use.  This means
that \mloo\ {\em must} contain the key algorithms in \ML that are in use today:  standard smoothed
aggregation, Petrov Galerkin for nonsymmetric systems, and reformulated Maxwell.

This document is organized as follows.
\SectionMueMat{In \S\ref{muemat}, we discuss the Matlab prototype multigrid code \muemat.}
\SectionMueLu{In \S\ref{muelu}, we adresses the design issues which are specific to \mloo.}
\SectionMueLuAPI{In \S\ref{api}, we describe the \mloo application programming interface (API).}
