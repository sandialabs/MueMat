%% MueMat Toolbox Overview
%
%% Target Problems
% The MueMat Toolbox provides a variety of algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods for the solution of linear systems
% $Ax=b$.  Theoretically, these methods
% are appropropriate for symmetric positive definite linear systems arising from self-adjoint
% elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs).  However, these methods can also be applied to other linear
% systems, e.g., those arising parabolic PDEs such as the convection-diffusion equations.
% It _may_ be possible to apply the AMG solvers in MueMat to semi-definite linear systems, as long as
% the right hand side and initial guess are in the range space of the matrix.
%
%% Implemented Multigrid Algorithms
% MueMat has implementations of smoothed aggregation AMG and a constrained energy-minimizing AMG method.  The latter
% method is appropriate for linear systems arising from systems of PDEs where the number of near-kernel components
% is greater than the number of degrees of freedom per node.
%
% MueMat does not contain any geometric multigrid or classic (aka Ruge-Stueben) AMG methods.
%
%% Smoothers
% MueMat provides point and block versions of Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and symmetric Gauss-Seidel smoothers. MueMat
% also implements a Chebyshev polynomial smoother.
%
%% Extensibility
% MueMat is designed for researching and developing new algorithms and to provide straight-forward extensibility.
% Thus, one could implement new geometric or algebraic methods and integrate them easily into the existing project. 
%
%% Advanced Usage
% One can create hybrid methods that combine two or more multigrid methods. For example, one could create a
% preconditioner that is a two-level geometric multigrid method followed by an energy-minimization multigrid method.
%
% It is possible to access some parts of the Trilinos package ML via the mlmex interface.  (Please see the ML User's
% Guide for instructions on how to compile mlmex.)
