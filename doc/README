The documentation in MueMat/doc/html is generated by Matlab.  Please see
the "Adding documentation" page under the MueMat toolbox help.

doc pages (e.g. doc SaPFactory.m) can be printed and included in slides.
One way, is to 'view html source', copy and paste this to temp.html, 
invoke firefox temp.html, page setup (perhaps making a long custom page),
print to file (pdf), use display to convert to jpg
Another way to obtain temp.html is to use 'help2html SaPFactory.m' which convert M-help to an HTML form :
txt=help2html('SaPFactory.m'); fid=fopen('temp.html','w'); fprintf(fid, '%s',txt); fclose(fid);
